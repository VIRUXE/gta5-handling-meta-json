# Convert an `handling.meta` file to *JSON* format

Why? Because I wanted to use the data in a web app. I'm sure there are other reasons. Maybe use it for a FiveM resource? I don't know.

## Converting from *XML* to *JSON*
I used this website `https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-to-json-converter.html` and `value` as the *#text property name* with no *Prefix* for the attributes, to convert the `.meta` file into an OK *JSON* format.
